# GH Recycle Shop

## Overview
GH Recycle Shop is an open-source platform designed for recycling event organizers. It enables them to create and host events, manage item listings, and conduct lotteries to determine who wins the items. The platform aims to streamline the recycling event management process and make it more engaging for participants.

**Note:** This project was originally developed as a specialized tool for my university's student house, known as Global House (GH), to aid in hosting recycling events. It's crafted with the vision to encourage sustainability and community engagement within the student body.
